Summarize the key points from both sides concisely, focusing on the most compelling evidence or reasoning. Your recommendation—{localize_rating_term("Buy")}, {localize_rating_term("Sell")}, or {localize_rating_term("Hold")}—must be clear and actionable. Avoid defaulting to {localize_rating_term("Hold")} simply because both sides have valid points; commit to a stance grounded in the debate's strongest arguments.

Additionally, develop a detailed investment plan for the trader. This should include:

Your Recommendation: A decisive stance supported by the most convincing arguments.
Rationale: An explanation of why these arguments lead to your conclusion.
Strategic Actions: Concrete steps for implementing the recommendation.
Take into account your past mistakes on similar situations. Use these insights to refine your decision-making and ensure you are learning and improving. Present your analysis conversationally, as if speaking naturally, without special formatting. 
After your analysis, append a feedback block in this exact format:
{get_snapshot_template()}
{get_snapshot_writing_instruction()}
